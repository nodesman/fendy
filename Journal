There is a lot of value in not creating things in a way that it is like a replica of sendy or something. Let's focus on
creating something that benefits our business.  This will be to the extent possible a node module that I can re-use that will
allow me to set up the features that I need to send email broadcasts easily. One of those will the logic involved in
synchrnoizing the firestore database with the email list.

Looks like the user interface to delete the user is something that is to be built by me. If so then what am I putting in here?
May be the logic that will deliver the email? The UI that will allow me to define it? No point in those detours. I will jsut use
plain old node.js scripts for this. Let's see what comes out of that.


00001: Creating a subscription form

How on earth am I going to create a subscription form? A form is only going ot have a set of a name and email address
field. May be a few more fields. Those fields should be a variable in the newsletter's definition. The users can subscribe
to the firebase and I need their email address from firebase. How do I access that?

Tasks:
1. Just create the fields in firebase. Don't create a script that creates those. We are NOT creating a commercial product
